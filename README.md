# Assignment-1-Java
In this assignment, you will create the Shape and Point classes to answer questions about a Shape that is made up of a collection of points from the x-y plane. The shape is defined by drawing a line between two adjacent points, for every pair of adjacent points, and also a line between the first and last point.      Create class Point      This class must contain two fields with x and y       Create a constructor that accepts two arguments x and y      Create setter and getter functions for x and y      Create function distance that accepts another point and return the distance between two points      Create a class Shape      This class must contain field points that stores all points of the shape      Create addPoint function that accepts a Point and add it to a field points      Create getPoints that return points       Create calculatePerimeter function that calculates the perimeter of the shape       Create a function that returns that longest side of the shape       Create a function that returns the average length of all sides       Create class AssignmentOne, read all points from the file       Create objects of Point and Shape classes       Check every function from Point and Shape classes   points:  file1.txt  -3, 9  -8, 7  -12, 4  -6, -2  -4, -6  2, -8  6, -5  10, -3  8, 5  4, 8  file2.txt  -4, -3  4, -2  12, 2  6, 5  -3, 3  -8, 1
